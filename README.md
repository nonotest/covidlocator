A map displays clusters (categorized by severity) of users having submitted COVID related symptoms.
The data is by default anonymous.

To make a submission:

1. login with a service that can verify your identity (to make sure people dont submit shit)
2. choose your symptoms severity
3. geo location
4. do you want to share the data with users in your network (fb social graph etc)
5. submit

Once you have logged in, there is an additional filter that allows you to see if anyone
in your network has submitted symptoms
